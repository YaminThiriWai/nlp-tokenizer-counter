# NLTK Tokenizer and Word Frequency Analysis

An example Python script utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text tokenization and word frequency analysis. Explore how NLTK can be used to break down text into words and analyze the frequency of each word in a given example string.

## Features

- NLTK tokenization
- Word frequency analysis using Counter

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`nltk`).
3. Run the Python script to tokenize the example string and display word frequencies.

## Usage

Explore the code to understand how NLTK can be leveraged for tokenization and word frequency analysis. Adapt and integrate these techniques into your own natural language processing projects.
